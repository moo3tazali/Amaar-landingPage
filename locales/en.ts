  deep-rooted experience, Amaar laid the cornerstone of its venture in the
  pulsating heart of the capital, Riyadh, at the beginning of 2019.
  Positioned as the hub of management and governance for its developmental
  projects in real estate development, and led by a team of ambitious
  youth, this towering entity embarked on studying the real estate market,
  scrutinizing its details, and analyzing client needs. This led to the
  creation of modern and contemporary residential products that meet those
  needs, alongside the adoption and innovation of developmental ideas to
  create diverse residential units fully equipped with smart home systems,
  providing security, comfort, and luxury. Additionally, sustainable
  development methods are implemented, aimed at conserving energy
  consumption.`,
